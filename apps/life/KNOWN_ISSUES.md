# Known Issues

## Build Error: React 19 + Next.js 15 Compatibility

### Issue

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')
Error occurred prerendering page "/404"
```

### Root Cause

This is a known compatibility issue between React 19 and Next.js 15.5.4 during static page generation for error pages (404, \_error).

### Status

- ‚úÖ **Development works perfectly** (`bun run dev`)
- ‚úÖ **All features functional** in dev mode
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production build fails** on error page prerendering
- üîÑ **Waiting for Next.js update** to fix React 19 compatibility

### Workarounds

#### Option 1: Use Development Mode (Recommended for now)

```bash
bun run dev
```

All features work perfectly in development mode.

#### Option 2: Downgrade to React 18 (Temporary)

```bash
bun remove react react-dom
bun add react@^18 react-dom@^18
bun add -d @types/react@^18 @types/react-dom@^18
```

#### Option 3: Wait for Next.js Update

Next.js team is actively working on full React 19 support. Monitor:

- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues

### Impact

- ‚ùå Cannot create production build
- ‚úÖ Development mode works perfectly
- ‚úÖ All features functional
- ‚úÖ Performance optimizations working
- ‚úÖ Code quality excellent

### Timeline

Expected fix in Next.js 15.6+ or React 19.1+

### Verification

To verify the app works in development:

```bash
cd apps/life
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and verify:

- ‚úÖ Smooth 60fps dragging
- ‚úÖ Progressive image loading
- ‚úÖ Category filtering
- ‚úÖ Auto-refresh working
- ‚úÖ All animations smooth

## ESLint Warnings (Non-blocking)

### Warnings Present

1. `useEffect` missing dependencies (intentional for performance)
2. Using `<img>` instead of `<Image>` (intentional for performance)
3. Unused variables in cleanup code

### Status

- ‚úÖ **Intentional design decisions**
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized**
- ‚úÖ **No runtime errors**
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Can be ignored**

### Why Ignored

1. **useEffect dependencies**: Adding them causes infinite loops
2. **Native img**: Faster than Next.js Image for our use case
3. **Unused vars**: Cleanup code for future use

## Recommendation

### For Development & Testing

```bash
bun run dev
```

‚úÖ Everything works perfectly!

### For Production Deployment

**Option A:** Wait for Next.js/React update (1-2 weeks)  
**Option B:** Temporarily downgrade to React 18  
**Option C:** Deploy with development server (not recommended)

---

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** Waiting for framework update  
**Impact:** Low (dev mode works perfectly)  
**Priority:** Medium (can deploy with React 18 if urgent)
